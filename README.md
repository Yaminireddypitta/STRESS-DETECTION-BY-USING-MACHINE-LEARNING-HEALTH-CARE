# EMPLOYEES STRESS-DETECTION-BY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING   (HEALTH-CARE)

Executive Summary:

Using Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Tkinter, I developed a machine learning application to detect employee stress levels from social media data. The system analyzes Twitter tweets and classifies them as Stressed or Not Stressed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest algorithms. After preprocessing text data and training both models, results showed that the Random Forest algorithm achieved an accuracy of 93%, outperforming SVM.

Based on the analysis, I recommend applying this approach in workplace analytics to help organizations identify early signs of employees stress, improve mental health support, and enhance productivity.

Business Problem:

Employee stress has a direct impact on productivity, engagement, and overall organizational performance. In many workplaces, it is difficult for HR or management teams to identify stressed employees early, as manual monitoring is time-consuming and subjective. The challenge is to develop an automated solution that can analyze employeesâ€™ social media activity or text data to detect signs of stress accurately and in real time. By leveraging machine learning, organizations can proactively identify at-risk employees and implement timely wellness or support interventions to improve mental health and productivity.
