# STRESS-DETECTION-BY-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING-HEALTH-CARE
This project detects employee stress using ML algorithms like SVM and Random Forest by analyzing Twitter tweets. Data is preprocessed with NLTK to remove stopwords and cleaned for training. A Tkinter GUI allows dataset upload, stress prediction, and accuracy visualization, with Random Forest achieving ~97% accuracy.
